This Unity project is a game that combines elements of card games like Hearthstone and quiz games like QuizUp. The goal is to have a game that successfully assesses knowledge and is engaging at the same time. 

My team and I are aiming for a playable alpha version by the end of September. If you're interested in testing, feel free to ping me at myhu@princeton.edu.

Readme will be updated with download link to the game.
