This Unity project is a game that combines elements of card games like Hearthstone and quiz games like QuizUp. The goal is to have a game that successfully assesses knowledge and is engaging at the same time. 

Our alpha version is out! Mac and Windows builds can be found on my GitHub. If you're interested in giving feedback, feel free to ping me at myhu@princeton.edu.
